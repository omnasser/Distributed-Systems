For this assignment, I had created a grade calculator for my CS102 class which was intermediate programming in C++, This program allows the user to enter their respective scores for each assignment or final exam and the student would then receive their final grade percentage based off the weight each category was given, and the score the student received.

The algorithm was created by myself and so was the GUI.
