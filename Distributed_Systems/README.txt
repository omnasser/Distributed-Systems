For this distributed systems assignment, me and my three other group members collaborated and created a fault-tolerant key-value-store system that supports replication, as well as data partitioning. We would be able to store pairs of key-values and even if our system crashed or anything happened, our system had very storng consistency, so all information would be saved and we would be able to retrieve the value of the key regardless. 
We included sharding/data-partitioning in this project to make the assignment run a lot faster and we were able to save a lot more time when we were running test cases because the data partitioning ensured that the data was spread out evenly and searching would be easier.
